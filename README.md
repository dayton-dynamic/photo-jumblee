# photo-jumblee
Nice face you've got there. Shame if it got all jumbled up.

Designed as a fun demonstration of programming for
DLUG / DDL's booth at  
Dayton's [TechFest 2025](http://www.techfestdayton.org/)

## Installing and Running

This project is set up with 
[pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation).  
After installing pixi, just `cd` into 
`photo-jumblee` and type `pixi run jumblee`

Currently supported key commands:

- `+`, `-`: More or fewer horizontal separations
- `q`: quit
- `s`: reshuffle tiles

## Testing

`pixi run test` 

Add more tests to photo-jumblee/tests using 
pytest conventions
